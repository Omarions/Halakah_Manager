public class ActivityReport {

	          //is it service class    so how cab U start ti cide here?   ho
// you will get list of objs of this class in the page and with Thymeleaf you can access its data
// like :
// totalActiveStudents
// totalWaitingStudents
// and so on
// I'll these data will not be computed here. there will be a service class to computed them and populate this class,
// and from the homeController I'll send you the list of obj of this class.
// have you used spring aop?
// I listen a course about it, but not work with it before.
//spring aop is all about for business layer (service's)
	// but does it mean to convert the project to Restful API?   no
	//it may restful api or mvc pattern
	// ok I can study it again and do it with Spring AOP
	//ok
	//so, do I'll convert all services to AOP?
	//yeah it will clean and easy code
	//ok, I'll start today
	//meanwhile, will you do something?
	//what time is it now there?
	// 7 PM
	// in egypt? yes
	//here in Bangladesh 11:02 PM now
	// Yeah, I know there is 4 hours
	// You'll use Thymeleaf, right?
	//yeah
	// the same design? i think
	// ok, will you reorganize the pages, until I finish AOP?
	// fix them? how can i reorganize the page?......and which pages?
	//redesign them, you know may add tables, budgets, charts or something like that.
	// i think we shoud just to code for backend so thath it made dynamic as it is a static page now.m i right?
	// no, all what you see is dynamic.
	// no static data, except to-do list, chat and email budgets in home page only
	// everything else is dynamic.
	//oh ....!  so whay we should do now?
//// you'll work on front-end and let pack-end for me
	// if you want to redesign it, it's Ok
	//ok......i will do
	// I'll work on pack-end, convert it to AOP, and from your design I'll send you the required data
	//ok send it
	// I sent you the github link
	//ok
	// you can clone it
	// or I'll create a new branch and fork it
	//just send a link i will clone it
	//okok
	// https://github.com/Omarions/Halakah_Manager/tree/Trial-Version        which data?
	// resourse is the directory of front-end
	// https://github.com/Omarions/Halakah_Manager/tree/Trial-Version/src/main/resources
	// wait....
	// if you'll redesign it, I won't know what data you'll need
	// what do you think?
	// first design one thing like table or chart just one sothat you can know what i am doing
	// ok, let me describe the project for you and what they mainly need.
	// It's like an archive
	// we need data to be shown (statistics) and some way to print it and email it, because they may report data by
	// phone only.
	// another thing, I don't implement a way to add new users.
	// and the data they care about are what I told you earlier.
	// beside that, you can activate your imagination to create something amazing. like what I did with maps and a
	// lot of charts.
	//well first which data chart you watn to build firssssst
	// We need to show statistics about countries and how many students from each one and status of them.
	// we need to show also about gender of students and ....like youtube? clear?
	// Yeah   so my task is just design it using thymleaf .right?
	// I'll need you in back-end but front-end it my weakness.
	// So, I need you there first. Hmm OK
	//All right tomorrow I will show you some status about my work something
	// great, I want to ask you about an issue.
	// It's ok, it'll be part of activities.
	// It's just not like the others, I mean if you look at it, you'll find that it has a direct relation with
	// student not like the ohters activities which have their relation through course ok.
	// so, what do you think about it? how to work with?
	// One model calss fields need to design or create then redesign a view part.
	// I mean from the front-end point of view.
	// I already have model and connect it with student model.
	// in front-end I don't have any thing for it.
	//ooh.....great ,so i need to design it just
	// ok , you have the db and the whole project.
	// I'll let you look at it and tomorrow you can show what you have, and if you need to ask about anything, tell
	// me anytime. OK?
	//Ok.
	// Now, I'll start studying AOP
	//ok good night
	//good night, what
